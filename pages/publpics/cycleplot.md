### Cycle Plot
##### What is a cycle plot?
Cycle plots are useful in showing trends in time series data. It can show whether or not a certain day of the week has more sales, or less sales, and plots each day of that week with all its other, then finds an average.

Example of a cycle plot showing item sales over an 8 week period:
![%1 pointers made 2008-2012](./NBA%20Cycle%20Plots%20-%20Rate%20of%20Made%20Shots/item_cycle.png)

In this figure, Wednesdays tend to show have a higher number of items sold.

##### NBA Cycle Plots
These plots show the proportion of made shots from 2008 to 2012 that are a 1-pointer, 2-pointer, 3-pointer per minute, then displays the average percentage per quarter using the black bar in the second graph below.

![%1 pointers made 2008-2012](./NBA%20Cycle%20Plots%20-%20Rate%20of%20Made%20Shots/1_Point_Made_Frequency.png)
Percentage of made shots that are 1 point  (free throws, technical foul shots, continuation) per minute

![%2 pointers made 2008-2012](./NBA%20Cycle%20Plots%20-%20Rate%20of%20Made%20Shots/2_Point_Made_Frequency.png)
Percentage of made shots that are 2 points per minute

![%3 pointers made 2008-2012](./NBA%20Cycle%20Plots%20-%20Rate%20of%20Made%20Shots/3_Point_Made_Frequency.png)
Percentage of made shots that are 3 points per minute

##### Summary
- Free throws (and technical free throws) appear to increase as the game goes on, with a spike towards the end of every quarter.
- There appears to be a decrease in made 2 pointers as the game progresses.
- The proportion of made shots that are 3 pointers  appears to be relatively unchanged over the course of a game.

![%Psych 112D Book Figure](./NBA%20Cycle%20Plots%20-%20Rate%20of%20Made%20Shots/CycleBook.png)
A plot I made of 2010-11 NBA free throw data is shown in Professor Michael D. Lee's Effective Graphical Display book. In this plot, towards the end of the 1st quarter, 40% of the shots made are free throws. And the average percentage of shots made that are free throws in the first quarter is approximately 22-25 %.
