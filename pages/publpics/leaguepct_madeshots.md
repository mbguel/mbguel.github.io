### League Percentage of Made Shots plot:

In this set of plots, we analyzed made shot data throughout a game from the entire league for each season from 2008-2012.   

We found that the proportion of free throws increased towards the end of a quarter. This could be due to teams entering the penalty towards the end of quarter, drawing free throws for shooting and non-shooting fouls.
