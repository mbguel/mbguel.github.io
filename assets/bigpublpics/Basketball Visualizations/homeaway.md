### Home & Away plot:

In these plots, we compared the proportion of made shots of the home and away team for the entire season. We used five seasons worth of data (2008-2012).

2011-12 (lockout-shortened)

Looking through five seasons' worth of made shot data, it appears that there is no discernible difference between the home and away team in their proportion of a team's made shots.


The graphs also show that free throws are made more frequently at the end of quarters, especially at the end of a game. This is typically the case because teams are in the penalty towards the end of a quarter, where non-shooting fouls also lead to free throw attempts. This also occurs at the end of a game when teams foul to extend the game, leading to more free throw attempts.
